**Darth-Vader-RPi** is a Raspberry Pi (RPi) project about activating a Darth
Vader action figure by turning LEDs on his spacesuit and lightsaber, and by
playing sounds such as some of his famous quotes.

The Darth Vader action figure is 11.5 inches tall (which is `this one from
Hasbro <https://amzn.to/3hIw0ou>`_) and was modified to make it more lifelike
by illuminating the lightsaber and the three slots in the chest control unit. 3
push buttons control the following sounds:

#. Some of his famous quotes
#. The Imperial march theme song
#. The lightsaber opening and closing sounds and its illumination

His iconic breathing sound plays in the background indefinitely as soon as the
RPi is run with the script.
