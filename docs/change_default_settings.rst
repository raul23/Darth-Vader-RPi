Important tips
==============
- As explained in `The main configuration file`_, this is the command to edit
  the configuration file with the **default** text editor::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

  Or with a **specific** text editor::

   $ start_dv -e cfg -a APP_NAME

- When adding audio files, don't use *mp3* as the file format. Instead, use
  *ogg* (compressed) or *wav* (uncompressed). The reason is that *mp3* won't
  work well with pygame's simultaneous playback capability.

  **Reference:** `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/a/59742418>`__

Add Darth Vader quotes
======================
The script ``start_dv`` comes included with two movie lines:

   - `"I am your father"`_
   - `"Nooooo"`_

.. TODO: check line in URL to config file showing ``quotes``

Quotes are represented in the `configuration file <https://github.com/raul23/Darth-Vader-RPi/blob/master/darth_vader_rpi/configs/default_main_cfg.json#L87>`__
as objects having the following properties:

   - ``name``: it will be displayed in the terminal
   - ``filename``: it is relative to the directory ``sounds_directory``
   - ``audio_channel_id``: all quotes should be played in **channel 1** as
     explained in `audio_channels <main_config.html#audio-channels-label>`__

If you want to add more Darth Vader quotes, you have to edit the setting
`quotes`_ in the configuration file. Open the configuration file with::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

Add your object representing the quote to the list in ``quotes``, like in the
following example:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6
   :caption: **Example:** adding a new quote

   "quotes": [
     {
       "name": "there_is_no_escape",
       "filename": "quote_there_is_no_escape.ogg",
       "audio_channel_id": 1
     }
   ]

Change channel volume
=====================
To change the volume for an audio channel, open the configuration file and edit
the channel's volume found in the setting `audio_channels`_::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 8, 12
   :caption: **Audio channels and their default volumes**

   "audio_channels": [
     {
       "audio_channel_id": 0,
       "volume": 0.2
     },
     {
       "audio_channel_id": 1,
       "volume": 1.0
     },
     {
       "audio_channel_id": 2,
       "volume": 1.0
     }
   ],

What each channel controls:

   - **Channel 0** controls Darth Vader's breathing sound
   - **Channel 1** controls the *Imperial March song* and all Darth Vader quotes
   - **Channel 2** controls the lighsaber sound effects and the closing sound

.. note::

   Volume takes values in the range 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive). As per the `pygame
   documentation <https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.Sound.set_volume>`__.

Change closing sound
====================
When the script is exitng after the user presses ``ctrl`` + ``c``, a sound is
produced which by default is the `"Nooooo"`_ quote.

To change the default closing sound, edit the setting `sound_effects`_ in the
configuration file which can be opened with::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

At the end of the list in ``sound_effects``, you will find the `closing_sound`_
object. These are the properties you can modify for this object:

   - ``filename``: relative to ``sounds_directory``
   - ``play_closing``: if `true`, the closing sound will be played when the
     script is finishing. Otherwise, nothing will be played at the end.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :caption: **Example:** choosing another closing sound by changing ``filename``

   "sound_effects": [
     {
       "name": "closing_sound",
       "filename": "bye.ogg",
       "audio_channel_id": 2,
       "play_closing": false
     }
   ]

Change GPIO channel names and number
====================================

Change keymap
=============
.. TODO: check line numbers before publishing

If you want to change the default keymap used for the three push buttons, edit
the setting `gpio_channels`_ in the configuration file which can be opened with::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

.. literalinclude:: ../darth_vader_rpi/configs/default_main_cfg.json
   :language: python
   :lines: 8-26
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 12, 18
   :caption: **Default keymap used for the three push buttons**

In order to change the default keymap, you will need to change the value for
``key`` which is the name of the keyboard key associated with a given push
button.

The names of keyboard keys that you can use are those specified in the
`SimulRPi's documentation`_, e.g. `media_play_pause`, `shift`, and `shift_r`.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 6
   :caption: **Example:** choosing ``shift_r`` for the *Quotes button*

    "gpio_channels": [
      {
        "channel_name": "quotes_button",
        "displa_name": "quotes_button",
        "channel_number": 25,
        "key": "shift_r"
      },
    ]

.. note::

   On mac, I recommend using the following keyboard keys because they don't
   require running the script ``start_dv`` with ``sudo``: *alt*, *alt_r*,
   *cmd*, *cmd_r*, *ctrl*, *ctrl_r*, *media_play_pause*,
   *media_volume_down*, *media_volume_mute*, *media_volume_up*, *shift*,
   and *shift_r*.

   **Ref.:** `Platform limitations`_

Change LED symbols
==================
By **default**, the symbols used for representing LEDs are the following:

   - üõë : LED turned ON
   - ‚ö™ : LED turned OFF

To change these default symbols, edit the setting `gpio_channels`_ by opening
the configuration file::

   $ start_dv -e cfg

As the name suggests, ``gpio_channels`` is a list of GPIO channels where each
item is an object defining a LED or a button and having the following
properties:

   - ``channel_name``: this property should **not be modified** because it is
     used to identify the correct GPIO channel when turning ON/OFF LEDs or
     checking a button's state.
   - ``display_name``: channel name that will be displayed in the terminal
     along with the LED symbol. By default, the channel number is displayed if
     ``display_name`` is not given.
   - ``channel_number``: based on the numbering system you have specified
     (`BOARD` or `BCM`).
   - ``led_symbols``: only defined for LED objects. It is a dictionary defining
     the symbols to be used when the LED is ON and OFF.

It is ``led_symbols`` that you need to modify in order to change the default
symbols for a given LED.

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 7-8
   :caption: **Example:** changing the symbols for the lightsaber LED

    "gpio_channels": [
      {
         "channel_name": "lightsaber_led",
         "display_name": "lightsaber",
         "channel_number": 22,
         "led_symbols": {
           "ON": "\\033[1;31;48m(0)\\033[1;37;0m",
           "OFF": "(0)"Ô∏è
         }
       }
    ]

.. note::

   If you omit ``led_symbols`` as a property for a LED object, the default LED
   symbols will be used instead.

.. seealso::

   `Change slot LEDs sequence <#change-slot-leds-sequence>`__

Change paths to audio files
===========================
.. TODO: revisit this section once you are done with testing the installation of the package
.. TODO: check line number in URL to config file for sounds_directory

The setting `sounds_directory`_ in the configuration file defines the directory
where all audio files (e.g. quotes) are saved.

The filename for each audio file is defined with respect to the directory
``sounds_directory``. Each audio object defined in the settings ``quotes``,
``songs`` and ``sound_effects`` have a ``filename`` property that you can
modify.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :caption: **Example:** filename for the *closing sound*

   "sound_effects": [
     {
       "name": "closing_sound",
       "filename": "quote_nooooo.ogg",
       "audio_channel_id": 2,
       "play_closing": false
     }
   ]

.. important::

   Don't change the ``name`` property for *songs* and *sound_effects* objects
   because it is used to identify the correct audio file to play when some
   event happens.
