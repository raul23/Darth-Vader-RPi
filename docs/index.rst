**Darth-Vader-RPi** is a Python-based Raspberry Pi project about activating a Darth Vader
action figure by turning on LEDs on his suit and lightsaber, and by playing
sounds such as some of his famous quotes. See the `README <README_docs.html>`_ for
more info about the project.

   important::

   If you don't have an RPi, don't worry. You can still test the program on
   your own computer because the package ``darth_vader_rpi`` uses the library
   `SimulRPi`_ to simulate I/O devices connected to an RPi such as LEDs and
   push buttons by blinking small circles on the terminal and playing sounds
   when a keyboard key is pressed. Almost like testing with a real RPi!

   **Disclaimer:** I also wrote the `SimulRPi`_ library
