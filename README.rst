**Darth-Vader-RPi** is a Python-based Raspberry Pi (RPi) project about activating a Darth
Vader action figure by turning on LEDs on his suit and lightsaber, and by
playing sounds such as some of his famous quotes.

`:warning:`

   If you don't have an RPi, don't worry. You can still test the program on
   your own computer because the package ``darth_vader_rpi`` uses the library
   ``SimulRPi`` to simulate I/O devices connected to an RPi such as LEDs and
   push buttons by blinking small circles on the terminal and playing sounds
   when a keyboard key is pressed. Almost like testing with a real RPi!

   **Disclaimer:** I also wrote the ``SimulRPi`` library

Introduction
============

The Darth Vader action figure is 11.5 inches tall (which is `this one from
Hasbro <https://amzn.to/3hIw0ou>`_) and was modified to make it more lifelike
by illuminating the lightsaber, chest control box, and belt. 3 push buttons
control the following sounds:

#. Some of his famous quotes
#. The Imperial march theme song
#. The lightsaber opening and closing sounds and its illumination

His iconic breathing sound plays in the background indefinitely as soon as the
RPi is run with the script.
